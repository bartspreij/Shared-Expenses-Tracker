/*    1. Initialize the flow network: Set the initial flow in each edge to 0.
      2. While there is a path from the source to the sink in the residual graph:
        1. Find a path from the source to the sink using a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search).
        2. Determine the minimum capacity along the path (i.e., the bottleneck capacity).
        3. Update the residual capacities of the edges and the flow through the edges.
      3. The maximum flow is the sum of the flow values on the edges outgoing from the source.
